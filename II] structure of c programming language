A C program is divided into six main sections, each serving a specific purpose:

I]Documentation Section: Contains comments that describe the program, its purpose, author, and other details.
For example:
// This program calculates the area of a circle
II]Preprocessor Section: Includes header files and macros. 
For example:
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14

III]Definition Section: Defines constants using the #define directive. 
For example:
#define MAX 100

IV]Global Declaration Section: Declares global variables and function prototypes. These are accessible throughout the program. 
For example:
int globalVar;
void myFunction();

V]Main() Function Section: The entry point of the program, where execution starts. It contains declarations and executable statements. 
For example:
int main() {
    int localVar;
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;}

VI]Subprogram Section: Contains user-defined functions that perform specific tasks. 
For example:
void myFunction() {
    printf("This is a user-defined function."); }
