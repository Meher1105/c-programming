 ▶ C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs to develop the UNIX operating system. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and low-level access to computer memory, making it highly suitable for system-level programming such as operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems.​

 ▶ Key Features
○ C supports structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion.​
○ It uses a small set of keywords and offers control flow constructs like if, for, while, and switch.​
○ C is designed to be compiled, providing direct access to hardware features with minimal runtime support.​
○ The language encourages cross-platform programming, allowing C programs to run on various computer architectures with few modifications.​

 ▶ Historical Significance
C was developed as a successor to the B programming language and was used to rewrite the UNIX kernel, which helped establish its widespread adoption. Over time, C has influenced many modern programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.​

 ▶ Applications
C is widely used in developing operating systems, compilers, network drivers, and applications that require high performance and hardware interaction. Its portability and efficiency have kept it relevant for decades, from supercomputers to microcontrollers.​
